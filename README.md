Comparative Analysis of Deep Learning Methods for CKD Diagnosis: Conducted an analysis using CNN and MobileNet models to classify and identify chronic kidney disease (CKD) from a trained dataset.
The notebook outlines the following key steps in the project:

Import Libraries: The required libraries for the project are imported.
Data Loading: The dataset is loaded into the environment for processing.
Data Preprocessing: Preprocessing steps are applied to prepare the data for modeling.
Applying CNN Algorithm: A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is implemented.
Applying MobileNet Algorithm: MobileNet, a lightweight deep learning model, is applied.
Calculate the Accuracy: The model's performance is evaluated based on accuracy metrics.
Classification Output: The final classification results are presented.
